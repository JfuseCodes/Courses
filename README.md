# Status: 🚧 Back-to-Coding Reboot - In Progress
Goal: Launch a product by Nov 28th

The Break: I've been away from coding for over a year, focusing on work and building out a career in IT. I'm returning to get some of my passion in coding back before the end of 2025 and hopefully set aside some time to continue building out my career as well as coding.

The Restart Goal: I will be starting out by taking a self guided course called "Full Stack Open" to re-master React and pick up Typescript.
